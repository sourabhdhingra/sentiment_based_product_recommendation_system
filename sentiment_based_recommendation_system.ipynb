        "2. `brand` - this is an important feature as it would uniquely identify what product brand to recomment.\n",

        "5. `name` - product's name for which review exist. This is what we will use to recommend to the user\n",
        "6. `reviews_date` - it may indicate on the reliability of reviews. If recent reviews are bad then old reviews then a user may rely more on the recent reviews.\n",
        "7. `reviews_didPurchase` - should matter as reviews where actual purchase did not happen should be ignored, they could have been done out of business competiion\n",
        "8. `reviews_doRecommend` - should matter as if the product recommended by user must have been rated positively, we can analyse further on it\n",
